# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

- Use Pydantic `alias` with `populate_by_name=True` when JSON uses camelCase but Python should use snake_case
- Use `by_alias=True` in `model_dump_json()` to serialize back to the original JSON format
- Import `Iterator`, `Sequence`, etc. from `collections.abc` instead of `typing` (ruff UP035)
- Use Pydantic `BaseModel` for all classes, NOT stdlib `@dataclass` - this is a Pydantic project
- Use `ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)` when fields use types like `Path` or `TextIO`

**Story:** Create skills sync service

### What was implemented
- Created `src/ralph/services/skills.py` with SkillsService class using Pydantic BaseModel
- Created `SyncStatus` enum for sync operation results (CREATED, UPDATED, SKIPPED, INVALID)
- Created `SkillInfo` model for skill metadata (name, description, path)
- Created `SkillSyncResult` model for sync operation results
- `list_local_skills()` - Finds skill directories containing SKILL.md in skills/ folder
- `validate_skill(path)` - Validates SKILL.md has required frontmatter (name, description)
- `sync_skill(skill_path)` - Copies skill to ~/.claude/skills/, returns status
- `sync_all()` - Syncs all valid skills, returns list of results
- `_parse_frontmatter()` - Simple YAML frontmatter parser without external dependency
- Updated `services/__init__.py` to export SkillsService, SkillInfo, SkillSyncResult, SyncStatus

### Files changed
- src/ralph/services/skills.py (new)
- src/ralph/services/__init__.py (modified)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Skills use SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description` fields
- Simple frontmatter parsing with regex avoids needing yaml dependency for this module
- Use shutil.copytree/rmtree for directory operations when syncing skills

- `append_file(path, content, encoding)` - Appends content, creates file if needed
- `file_exists(path)` - Checks if path exists and is a file

- Using `pathlib.Path` provides clean, cross-platform file operations
- `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` is equivalent to `mkdir -p`
- Always create parent directories when writing files to prevent errors
