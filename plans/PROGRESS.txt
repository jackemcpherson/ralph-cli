# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

- Use Pydantic `alias` with `populate_by_name=True` when JSON uses camelCase but Python should use snake_case
- Use `by_alias=True` in `model_dump_json()` to serialize back to the original JSON format
- Import `Iterator`, `Sequence`, etc. from `collections.abc` instead of `typing` (ruff UP035)
- Use Pydantic `BaseModel` for all classes, NOT stdlib `@dataclass` - this is a Pydantic project
- Use `ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)` when fields use types like `Path` or `TextIO`
- Use `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]` for type annotations (ruff UP045)

**Story:** Set up Typer CLI app with help and version

### What was implemented
- Updated `src/ralph/cli.py` with --version/-V flag using version_callback
- Created command stub modules in `src/ralph/commands/`:
  - `init_cmd.py` - Scaffold project for Ralph workflow (stub)
  - `prd.py` - Interactive PRD creation with Claude (stub)
  - `tasks.py` - Convert spec to TASKS.json (stub)
  - `once.py` - Execute single iteration (stub)
  - `loop.py` - Run multiple iterations (stub)
  - `sync.py` - Sync skills to ~/.claude/skills/ (stub)
- Updated `commands/__init__.py` to export all command functions
- Registered all commands in main CLI app with descriptive help text
- Commands currently display "not yet implemented" warning until later stories

### Files changed
- src/ralph/cli.py (modified)
- src/ralph/commands/__init__.py (modified)
- src/ralph/commands/init_cmd.py (new)
- src/ralph/commands/prd.py (new)
- src/ralph/commands/tasks.py (new)
- src/ralph/commands/once.py (new)
