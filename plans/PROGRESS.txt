**Story:** Add Bicep language detection support

### What was implemented
- Added `bicep` to the `Language` enum in `src/ralph/services/language.py`
- Introduced `_LANGUAGE_PATTERNS` dictionary for glob-based language detection
- Added `**/*.bicep` pattern to detect Bicep files anywhere in the project tree
- Updated `LanguageDetector.detect()` method to check both marker files and glob patterns

### Tests written
- `test_detects_bicep_from_bicep_files` - Verifies Bicep detected from .bicep files in root
- `test_detects_bicep_in_subdirectory` - Verifies Bicep detected from .bicep files in subdirectories

### Files changed
- `src/ralph/services/language.py` - Added bicep enum value and glob-based detection
- `tests/test_language_detection.py` - Added 2 tests for Bicep detection

### Learnings for future iterations
- Glob-based detection using `Path.glob()` is needed for languages without specific marker files
- The `**/*.ext` pattern allows detecting files in any subdirectory
