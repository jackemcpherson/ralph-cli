**Story:** Add --no-fix flag to review commands

### What was implemented
- Added `--no-fix` boolean flag (default: False) to the `loop()` command in `src/ralph/commands/loop.py`
- Added `--no-fix` boolean flag (default: False) to the `review()` command in `src/ralph/commands/review.py`
- Threaded `no_fix` parameter through `_run_review_loop()` in `loop.py` (signature + call site)
- Help text: "Report review findings without applying automated fixes"

### Tests written
- No new tests needed for this story (flag plumbing only; behavior implementation is US-002)
- All 217 existing tests pass

### Files changed
- `src/ralph/commands/loop.py` - added `no_fix` param to `loop()` and `_run_review_loop()`
- `src/ralph/commands/review.py` - added `no_fix` param to `review()`
- `plans/TASKS.json` - marked US-001 as passes: true

### Learnings for future iterations
- Typer `--no-fix` automatically maps to `no_fix` Python parameter via Typer's flag naming convention
- The `_run_review_loop()` function in loop.py is the bridge between the loop command and the review pipeline; subsequent stories (US-002, US-003) will wire no_fix into ReviewLoopService
