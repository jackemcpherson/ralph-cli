**Story:** Initialize project structure with pyproject.toml

### What was implemented
- Created pyproject.toml with all required dependencies (typer, rich, pydantic, ruff, pytest, pytest-cov, pyright)
- Configured hatchling build backend with src layout
- Set up Python 3.11+ requirement
- Created src/ralph/ directory structure with __init__.py files
- Created empty module directories: commands/, models/, services/, utils/
- Created basic cli.py with Typer app entry point
- Added README.md with basic documentation
- Added .gitignore for Python projects
- Added initial test for version verification
- Verified package installs successfully with `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`

### Files changed
- pyproject.toml (new)
- README.md (new)
- .gitignore (new)
- src/ralph/__init__.py (new)
- src/ralph/cli.py (new)
- src/ralph/commands/__init__.py (new)
- src/ralph/models/__init__.py (new)
- src/ralph/services/__init__.py (new)
- src/ralph/utils/__init__.py (new)
- tests/__init__.py (new)
- tests/test_init.py (new)

### Learnings for future iterations
- pytest returns exit code 5 when no tests are collected, so at least one test file is needed
- hatchling requires README.md to exist if referenced in pyproject.toml
- uv requires a virtual environment to be created first with `uv venv`
